LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT swervolf/swerv_soc_i/ptc_wrapper_0/inst/timer_ptc/rptc_cntr[31]_i_3 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock swervolf/swerv_soc_i/VGA_v1_0_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin swervolf/swerv_soc_i/VGA_v1_0_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_core and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.

DSP swervolf/swerv_soc_i/swerv_wrapper_verilog_0/inst/swerv_eh1_2/swerv/exu/mul_e1/prod_e20__2 input pin swervolf/swerv_soc_i/swerv_wrapper_verilog_0/inst/swerv_eh1_2/swerv/exu/mul_e1/prod_e20__2/B[4] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
